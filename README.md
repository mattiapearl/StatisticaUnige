# StatisticaUnige

This repository serves the purpose of tracking my work in our data analysis class at Unige

### Code
All of the code is written in R. 
Most files are then knitted to html documents for easier readability and more organized viewing

## Folders
Folders either contain assigned lab work or extenral excercises.

- EsBook
Is a folder for external excercises, devided by section and based off various books

- EsercitazioneN 
Are folders containing R projects which were assigned during lab sessions.
Each project uses particular datasets which won't be uploaded after the adult.txt one, given their increasing size
